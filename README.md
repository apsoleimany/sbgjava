# sbgjava 

`sbgjava` is a Java library for accessing the [Seven Bridges Genomics API](https://docs.sbgenomics.com/display/developerhub/API). 

## Dependencies 

The `sbgjava` library uses [Apache HttpClient](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/) to execute HTTP requests and formats server responses according to the [JSON specification](http://www.json.org).
